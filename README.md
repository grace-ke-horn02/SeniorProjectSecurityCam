Developed security camera system with black out capabilities for predefined areas, with pan motion, tamper detection, movement detection, app communication, and facial recognition capabilities
Implemented software to interface with and manage peripheral sensors on Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano
Designed and implemented logic for synchronized sensor, video, and server operations
Integrated HTTP server, sensor subsystems, video capture, live video streaming, image processing, facial recognition, and file-management components into a unified application

All files in Facial_Detection_Model5 were not created by me, though I did integrate them. The modules in cam_functions were also not fully written by me.
